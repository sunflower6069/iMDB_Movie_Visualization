# iMDB_Movie_Visualization
IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs,
and video games, including cast, production crew, fictional characters, biographies,
plot summaries, trivia and reviews. Our project takes advantage of this resource to
build our own database in SQLite, allowing for general queries and data analysis about
movies, such as the publish dates and genre relationships. We have also built a web
interface for visualization of the results.
